## Ethics Homework

Deadline: Nov. 27th, 2017.
Credit: Up to 10.

Every team is expected to upload a discussion of an ethics related case study. This can be in the form of a essay, a cartoon, or a compiled audio/video (a sketch of the situation, or a discussion among the team members for example). 

The hand-in must include:
1. Links/references on the case you are discussing
2. Brief explanation of the case you are discussing.
3. Define who the stake holders are.
4. Try to address the situation with a [utilitarian test](https://www.ethicsops.com/best-outcomes-test), a [justice test](https://www.ethicsops.com/justice-test), and a [virtue test](https://www.ethicsops.com/blank-3) as discussed in class.
5. What are the economic, social, and political constraints that play in to this scenario?
6. Are there creative solutions that would benefit all stake holders?

Feel free to find your own case study. Alternatively, you can pick from one of the topics below:

* [Autonomous drones and warfare](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/2017/Also-in-2017/autonomous-military-drones-no-longer-science-fiction/EN/index.htm)
* [Tesla driver dies in first fatal car crash](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk)
