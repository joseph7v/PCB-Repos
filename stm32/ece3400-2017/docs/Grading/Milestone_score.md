# Grading of Milestones
## ECE 3400, Fall 2017

The grading of all milestones will be based on what is reported on the websites. Although the TAs will be available to answer any questions during the normal lab-hours, they will not provide specific guidance on how you should meet these deadlines. These will be up to the teams themselves to coordinate.

Please be advised that you can receive partial points for any of these goals if you explanation is unclear or your implementation is lacking.

### Milestone 1 will be graded as follows:

* 2 points: A robot that successfully follows a line of black tape.
* 3 points: A robot that successfully traverses a grid of black tape in a figure eight.
* Up to 5 points will be given for implementation (related to the robustness of the solution and the speed of the robot)

### Milestone 2 will be graded as follows:

* 2.5 points (total of 7.5) per different treasure that can be detected and classified (the frequencies will be 7kHz, 12kHz, and 17kHz).
* 2.5 points to autonomously detect walls

### Milestone 3 will be graded as follows:

* 4 points: Working simulation that facilitates maze exploration, and can indicate when the robot has explored everything that is explorable. Please discuss what your goal for the simulation is, and what it has allowed you to try.
* 4 points: Algorithm implemented on the actual robot that facilitates maze exploration, and indicates when the robot has explored everything that is explorable. The algorithm implemented does not have to be the same as the one in the simulation.
* 2 points: _Looking ahead_. The goal of this milestone is for you to establish what needs to get done in the time you have left. 2 points will be given for a clear plan of action of what needs to happen, and who will do what. The more details the better. 

You donâ€™t have to worry about treasures/microphone circuitry yet, for either the simulation or the real-life maze exploration. You do have to include walls. We do not expect everyone to have a perfectly running system in this milestone, the goal is for everyone to start the implementation and think about (and convey on the website) what next tasks/improvements need to be done to compete in the final competition. 

### Milestone 4 will be graded as follows:

* 3 points: System that successfully displays the walls in a maze as the robot finds them
* 3 points: System that successfully displays treasures in a maze as the robot finds them
* 2 points: Robot that successfully signals 'done' on the screen when the maze has been mapped
* 2 points: Robot that successfully plays 'done' on the speaker when the maze has been mapped

Notice, that this milestone is focused on the FPGA display. You can pull off most this milestone with a simulated robot traversal if your robot is not finished.
