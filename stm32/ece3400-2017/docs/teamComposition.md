# ECE 3400: Intelligent Physical Systems, Cornell University

## Team Composition

The teams will be composed by the TA's and lecturer *without exception*.

Teams will be dependent on lab-time sign-up, student skillsets, and personalities. Before midnight August 23rd please fill out these [Google forms](https://goo.gl/forms/G54ZCPmXbgT65QS32) such that the teams can be formed immediately.

All labs are divided into two sub-labs. To ensure a good mix, it is required that you keep switching partners for the different labs. For example, if student A-F is a team; lab 1 should be solved by A-B-C and D-E-F; lab 2 by A-C-D and B-E-F; lab 3 by A-D-E and B-C-F; and lab 4 by A-E-F and B-C-D. Be sure to note what team members solve the sub labs on the website.

We will prompt team evaluations and practice constructive criticism. Receiving and giving professional feedback may be uncomfortable at first, but it is a skill that will help you in any future career.

This [folder](./Grading/Readme.md) includes documents detailing how students will be graded. Be aware that a lot of changes has been made for Fall 2017 and that the score-chart may be changed throughout the semester.
