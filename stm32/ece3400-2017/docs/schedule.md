# ECE 3400 Intelligent Physical Systems

### Cornell University, Fall 2017

[Return to main page](https://cei-lab.github.io/ece3400/)

# Schedule

You can [access the PH427 lab](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ece34002017%40gmail.com&ctz=America/New_York) any time a TA is available. Be aware that if a lab session is ongoing you will have to yield the space to those who are signed up. 

You can also access the PH414 Skunkworks lab during open lab hours, IF both you and your TA has been trained. We will be using the buddy system - basically, you are NEVER allowed to be in there without at least one other person present. That also counts if your buddy just need to step out for a couple of minutes! If we find that anyone does not follow the Buddy system, or mistreats equipment in that space, you will loose access for the rest of the semester.
