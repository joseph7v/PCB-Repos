Construction by Slimemold-Inspired Soft Robot Collectives
- Bodies composed of hydrogels, with two chambers internally
- Add two component materials inside at a higher pressure
- Extrude foam to build structures and propel forward
- Signal to other robots via heat from extruded foam
- Or have heterogeneous robots that extrude one liquid component, which only reacts when another robot crosses its path
- Completely expendable, cheap
- Rigidity change
- Can be made passive?
- If there is control electronics, can this become useful in the final structure as well?
- Grand goal: Construct dams, bridges, supporting pillars in rubble
