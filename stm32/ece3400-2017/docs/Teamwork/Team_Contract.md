## Preparation for Team work

You will be assigned a team of 5-7 students who you will work with throughout the semester. Every 2-3 weeks you will take turns being the group leader. Team work has a lot of benefits; you get a lot of different insights to solve a problem, you can work efficiently on many tasks at once, and you always have someone to check your work. It is important to be aware that in a team environment, individuals are usually effectively motivated to maximize their own rewards and minimize their own costs. Therefore, successful team performance depends on individual accountability. Writing up a team contract, and doing team assessments throughout the semester can help keep everyone on track. This is good preparation for what will happen when you move on to industry or academia, you will end up as part of a team almost anywhere you go.

According to concepts from Organizational Behavior, there are five stages of team development: _forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning_. During the forming stage, teams tend to communicate in indirect polite ways rather than more directly. The storming stage, characterized by conflict, can be often be productive, but may consume excessive amounts of time and energy. In this stage it is important to listen well for differing expectations. Next, during the norming stage, teams formulate roles and standards, increasing trust and communication. This norming stage is characterized by agreement on procedures, reduction in role ambiguity, and increased “we-ness” or unity.  These developments generally are precursors to the performing stage, during which teams achieve their goals, are highly task oriented, and focus on performance and production. The point of the team contract is to help you move to the performing stage faster.

If you find that your team is dysfunctional in any away you should address this immediately by calling a team meeting. If problems persist, seek help from TAs or the instructor.

## Team Contract Assignment

Your team contract template is divided into three major sections:

1.	establishing team procedures
2.	identifying expectations
3.	specifying the consequences for failing to follow these procedures and fulfill these expectations

Use the Team Contract template to discuss and finalize your team roles, procedures, and standards. Complete, sign, and upload a copy of your finalized contract to your team website by Monday, August 28th 8am.
