Usage [app]:  make clean && make && sudo make deploy
Usage [test]: make test-clean && make test-deps && make test && sudo make check

              Works with STM32F4-Disocvery /w STM32F4-BB
              Unit Test Results are Displayed on UART 6 Serial Device (that is routed to RS-232 interface of the STM32F4-BB board)
              cat /dev/ttyS0 (cat /dev/ttyUSB0)
