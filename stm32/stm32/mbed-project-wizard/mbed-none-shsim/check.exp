#!/usr/bin/expect -f
#
# Description: Deploys unit test binary on to the ARM QEMU simulator and monitors the test output in a
#              semihosting environment. There are 3 possible exit codes:
#              - If test results are OK, then the exit code is 0. 
#              - If one or more test fails, then the exit code is 2.
#              - If one or more test fails to execute, then the exit code is 1.
#              - The test execution timeouts after 240 seconds with the exit code 1.
